    <p>
        My name is Francesco Porzio, and I’m currently studying Science and Technology at university.
        I chose this field because I’ve always been fascinated by how scientific discoveries and technological innovation can work together to improve our everyday lives.
    </p>

    <p>
        I’m particularly interested in environmental technology and sustainable solutions,
        as I believe that combining science with innovation is key to building a better future.
    </p>

    <p>
        Outside of my studies, I enjoy hiking, playing the guitar, and experimenting with small tech projects in my free time.
        These hobbies help me stay creative and curious, which I think are essential qualities for anyone in the scientific field.
    </p>

    <p>
        I’m really looking forward to learning more during this course and collaborating with all of you on new ideas and projects.<br>
        Thank you!
    </p>
